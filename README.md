Mode 0 is regular mode moving the ghost around, mode 1 is activated when in mode 0 and pressing the button allowing the user to pass through walls, mode 2 is when pac-man has eaten a pellet and must run away. 

the red led is on when mode 1 is, the blue led is on when mode 2 is, the motors vibrate when mode 2 is on as the player is in danger. 

Updated the fusion 360 files for each of the components, I made the shell vaguely ghost shaped with holes for the leds, button, joystick, and usb connection to the ardunio micro, and included both the shell's technical drawing, and the full assembly
